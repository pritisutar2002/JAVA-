/*
Design patterns : are the predefined ways or structures of programming or coding which can be used to avoid the recurring development issues or
to meet some requirements in the application

Design pattern catelog: Is the collection multiple Design patterns. if the developers come-up with a new way of writing a program in order to avoid a specific issue in the 
appli or in odrder to meet a specific requirement in the appli then that way of programming can be considered as a new design pattern, and can be added new design patterns.

Note : Basically DP are the diff ways of building of an appli.
       Based on the type of issue or the type of requirement DP are categoried in to several types .
       Widely used DP are 1.Creational DP   2.Structural DP 
       
       1. Creational Design patterns : CDP are used to avoid development issue or to meet specific requirement associated with object creatin process in an appli.
       Widely used CDP are : 1.Singleton DP 2. Factory DP  3. Builder DP 
       
       A] Singleton DP : SDP is used to ristrict the user from creating multiple and unneccessory of objects of class. The class for which Multiple object creation is ristricted is 
       called as Singleton class.
       --- Lasy instancittion in SDP.
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       -- Factory method :A method which creates a specific object & returns it in the application is called as Factory method.
       B] Factory Design pattern:
        In an application a developer deals with multiple objects if developer creates multiple objects and keeps them ready which might be required yo execute specific task in the application 
       but there is chance that one of the created objects might remain unused in the application that leads to wastage of memory in order to avoid this issue in application 
       we can make use of FDP where objects will be created by the factory methods whenever there is demand for those object in the appli . in this way we can make our appli more efficient with respect to memory utilization
    
       C]Builder Design Pattern
       BDP is used to create a complex object step by step . A user can create or can initilize complex object according to the requirement
       Complex Object:- Complex object is an object which contains multiple properties to be initilized with some validation and verification 
       A complex object might consist of some other simple object as properties 
       
       In Builder Design Pattern we will make use of one helper class called as Builder class which will help us to create complex object step by 
       step according to the requirements
       
       2.Structural design pattern:SDP are used to deal with issues or the requirements associated with structures of class and interface.
       
       widely use SDP is Adapter DP.  in ADP we will make use of one intermediate module (class or interface)  called as adapter which will
        establish bet two other modules without modifying the structures of those two modules
